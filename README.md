#  Netflix Watch Prediction – CaseCraft Analytics Sprint Project 1

## 🔍 Overview  
This project simulates a Netflix-style recommendation scenario, focusing on user watch behavior across genres, time slots, and devices. It blends exploratory data analysis with predictive modeling to estimate content liking, offering a hands-on dive into consumer analytics.

## 🎯 Objective  
To analyze and model user watch behavior using genre preferences, time of day, and device usage. The goal is to uncover engagement patterns and build a logistic regression model to predict whether a user liked the content.

## 📊 Dataset Summary  
- `user_id`: Unique identifier  
- `genre`: Type of content watched  
- `watch_time`: Time slot (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)  
- `device`: Viewing device (Mobile, TV, Laptop, Tablet)  
- `duration_minutes`: Total watch time  
- `liked`: Binary flag (1 = liked, 0 = not liked)

## 📈 Visual Explorations  
- Genre popularity distribution  
- Average watch duration by genre  
- Device usage across time slots  
- Liked vs not liked content by genre  
- Heatmap of genre-device engagement  
- Boxplot of watch duration by time of day
